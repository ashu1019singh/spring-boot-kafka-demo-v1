Simple spring boot kafka code to verify that we can send some message and receive back 

NOTE: 

1.	Ensure that zookeeper and kafka are up in your local machine before running this code

2.	Create a topic with name test1 where we should push the messages







Setup for Kafka:


1.  Downloading and Extracting the Kafka Binaries

    mkdir ~/kafka
    This will be the base directory of the Kafka installation:

    Use curl to download the Kafka binaries:
    curl "http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/kafka/1.1.0/kafka_2.12-1.1.0.tgz" -o ~/Downloads/kafka.tgz
    
    Extract the archive you downloaded using the tar command:
    tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/kafka.tgz --strip 1

    We specify the --strip 1 flag to ensure that the archive's contents are extracted in ~/kafka/ itself and not in another directory (such as ~/kafka/kafka_2.12-1.1.0/) inside of it.
    
    Now that we've downloaded and extracted the binaries successfully, we can move on configuring to Kafka to allow for topic deletion.

2.  Configuring the Kafka Server

    Kafka's default behavior will not allow us to delete a topic, the category, group, or feed name to which messages can be published. To modify this, let's edit the configuration file.
    
    Kafka's configuration options are specified in server.properties. Open this file with nano or your favorite editor:
    nano ~/kafka/config/server.properties
    
    Let's add a setting that will allow us to delete Kafka topics. Add the following to the bottom of the file:
    ~/kafka/config/server.properties
    delete.topic.enable = true
    
    Save the file, and exit nano. Now that we've configured Kafka, we can move on to creating systemd unit files for running and enabling it on startup.

3.  Creating Systemd Unit Files and Starting the Kafka Server

    In this section, we will create systemd unit files for the Kafka service. This will help us perform common service actions such as starting, stopping, and restarting Kafka in a manner consistent with other Linux services.

    Zookeeper is a service that Kafka uses to manage its cluster state and configurations. It is commonly used in many distributed systems as an integral component. If you would like to know more about it, visit the official Zookeeper docs.

    Create the unit file for zookeeper:
        sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/zookeeper.service
    
    Enter the following unit definition into the file:
        [Unit]
        Requires=network.target remote-fs.target
        After=network.target remote-fs.target

        [Service]
        Type=simple
        ExecStart=/home/ashutosh/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh /home/ashutosh/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties
        ExecStop=/home/ashutosh/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-stop.sh
        Restart=on-abnormal
        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target

    The [Unit] section specifies that Zookeeper requires networking and the filesystem to be ready before it can start.

    The [Service] section specifies that systemd should use the zookeeper-server-start.sh and zookeeper-server-stop.sh shell files for starting and stopping the service. It also specifies that Zookeeper should be restarted automatically if it exits abnormally.

    Next, create the systemd service file for kafka:
        sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/kafka.service
    
    Enter the following unit definition into the file:
        [Unit]
        Requires=zookeeper.service
        After=zookeeper.service

        [Service]
        Type=simple
        ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/home/ashutosh/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start.sh /home/ashutosh/kafka/config/server.properties > /home/ashutosh/kafka/kafka.log 2>&1'
        ExecStop=/home/ashutosh/kafka/bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
        Restart=on-abnormal

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
    
    The [Unit] section specifies that this unit file depends on zookeeper.service. This will ensure that zookeeper gets started automatically when the kafa service starts.

    The [Service] section specifies that systemd should use the kafka-server-start.sh and kafka-server-stop.sh shell files for starting and stopping the service. It also specifies that Kafka should be restarted automatically if it exits abnormally.

    Now that the units have been defined, start Kafka with the following command:
        sudo systemctl start kafka
    
    To ensure that the server has started successfully, check the journal logs for the kafka unit:
        journalctl -u kafka


    You should see output similar to the following:
    Output
    Aug 06 15:47:20 ashutosh-stackroute systemd[1]: Started kafka.service.

    You now have a Kafka server listening on port 9092.

    While we have started the kafka service, if we were to reboot our server, it would not be started automatically. To enable kafka on server boot, run:

    sudo systemctl enable kafka
    Now that we've started and enabled the services, let's check the installation.

4 â€” Testing the Installation
    Let's publish and consume a "Hello World" message to make sure the Kafka server is behaving correctly. Publishing messages in Kafka requires:

    A producer, which enables the publication of records and data to topics.
    A consumer, which reads messages and data from topics.
    First, create a topic named test1 by typing:

        ~/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test1

    You can create a producer from the command line using the kafka-console-producer.sh script. It expects the Kafka server's hostname, port, and a topic name as arguments.

    Publish the string "Hello, World" to the test1 topic by typing:

        echo "Hello, World" | ~/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test1 > /dev/null
    
    Next, you can create a Kafka consumer using the kafka-console-consumer.sh script. It expects the ZooKeeper server's hostname and port, along with a topic name as arguments.
    
    The following command consumes messages from test1. Note the use of the --from-beginning flag, which allows the consumption of messages that were published before the consumer was started:

        ~/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test1 --from-beginning

    If there are no configuration issues, you should see Hello, World in your terminal:

    Output
    Hello, World

    The script will continue to run, waiting for more messages to be published to the topic. Feel free to open a new terminal and start a producer to publish a few more messages. You should be able to see them all in the consumer's output.

    When you are done testing, press CTRL+C to stop the consumer script. Now that we have tested the installation, let's move on to installing KafkaT.
